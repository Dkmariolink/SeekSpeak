# YouTube Caption Search Extension - Design Document

## Problem Statement

Users watching long-form YouTube content (30+ minutes) often want to revisit specific topics or moments but struggle to locate them efficiently. The current transcript feature requires:
- Multiple clicks to access
- Manual scrolling through walls of text  
- Awkward ctrl+f searching in a small popup
- No visual integration with the video timeline

This creates friction when users want to quickly jump to specific topics, especially in educational content, podcasts, and video essays.

## Solution Overview

A Chrome extension that adds an intuitive caption search interface directly to YouTube, allowing users to:
- Search for words/phrases in video captions
- See contextual results with timestamps
- Jump directly to any matching moment
- Preview surrounding context before jumping
- Access search history for the current video

## Core Features

### 1. Search Interface
- **Search Bar**: Floating or integrated search box on YouTube video pages
- **Auto-suggestions**: Real-time suggestions as user types
- **Search History**: Remember recent searches for the current video session
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick access (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+F)

### 2. Results Display
- **Contextual Snippets**: Show 2-3 sentences around each match
- **Multiple Results**: List all instances where the term appears
- **Timestamp Integration**: Clear time markers (e.g., "14:32")
- **Clickable Results**: One-click navigation to any timestamp

### 3. Visual Integration
- **Timeline Markers**: Optional visual indicators on YouTube's progress bar
- **Highlight Mode**: Highlight search terms in YouTube's native transcript
- **Non-intrusive Design**: Matches YouTube's UI aesthetic

### 4. Advanced Search
- **Phrase Search**: Support for exact phrase matching
- **Fuzzy Search**: Handle minor typos and variations
- **Case Insensitive**: Default behavior with option to toggle
- **Word Boundaries**: Smart matching (avoid partial word matches)

### Core Components

#### 1. Caption Data Management
```javascript
class CaptionFetcher {
  // Fetch captions from YouTube's internal API
  async fetchCaptions(videoId)
  
  // Parse and normalize caption data
  processCaptionData(rawData)
  
  // Cache captions for session
  cacheCaption(videoId, captions)
}
```

#### 2. Search Engine
```javascript
class SearchEngine {
  // Index captions for fast searching
  buildSearchIndex(captions)
  
  // Perform search with context
  search(query, options = {})
  
  // Return results with timestamps and context
  formatResults(matches)
}
```

#### 3. UI Integration
```javascript
class UIController {
  // Inject search interface into YouTube
  injectSearchUI()
  
  // Handle search interactions
  handleSearch(query)
  
  // Navigate to timestamp
  jumpToTimestamp(seconds)
}
```

### Data Flow
1. **Page Load**: Detect YouTube video page
2. **Caption Fetch**: Retrieve caption data via YouTube's APIs
3. **Index Building**: Create searchable index from captions
4. **UI Injection**: Add search interface to page
5. **Search Processing**: Handle user queries and return results
6. **Navigation**: Jump to selected timestamps

## User Experience Design

### Search Interface Options

#### Option A: Floating Search Bar
- Positioned over video player (top-right corner)
- Appears on hover or keyboard shortcut
- Minimizes when not in use
- Always accessible but non-intrusive

#### Option B: Integrated Panel
- Sidebar panel that slides out from right
- Dedicated space for results and history
- Better for complex searches
- More screen real estate required

#### Selected Approach: Popup Overlay ✓
- Modal-style overlay triggered by button/shortcut
- Full search functionality in dedicated space
- Can be dismissed easily
- Non-intrusive for short videos where search isn't needed
- Perfect balance of accessibility and minimal footprint

### User Flow
1. User opens YouTube video
2. Extension detects video and fetches captions
3. User activates search (button/shortcut)
4. User types search query
5. Real-time results appear with context
6. User clicks result to jump to timestamp
7. Video navigates to selected moment

### Visual Design Principles
- **Native Feel**: Match YouTube's design language
- **Minimal Footprint**: Don't interfere with video watching
- **Fast Interaction**: Immediate feedback and quick navigation
- **Responsive**: Work on different screen sizes
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Caption Data Access
**Problem**: YouTube's caption API may have restrictions
**Solutions**: 
- Use YouTube's internal APIs that the web player uses
- Fallback to parsing transcript from page DOM
- Handle different caption sources (auto-generated vs manual)

### Challenge 2: Performance
**Problem**: Large videos have extensive caption data
**Solutions**:
- Implement efficient search indexing (inverted index)
- Use Web Workers for heavy processing
- Cache processed data in browser storage

### Challenge 3: YouTube Updates
**Problem**: YouTube frequently updates their interface
**Solutions**:
- Use stable selectors and robust DOM queries
- Implement fallback detection methods
- Monitor for breaking changes

### Challenge 4: Cross-Language Support
