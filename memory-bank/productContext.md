# SeekSpeak Product Context

## Problem Statement

### Current YouTube Transcript Pain Points
- **Multiple Clicks Required**: Users must click transcript button, then navigate small popup
- **Poor Search Experience**: Ctrl+F in tiny popup window with no context
- **Manual Scrolling**: Searching through walls of text to find moments
- **No Visual Integration**: Disconnect between transcript and video timeline
- **Awkward Navigation**: Clicking transcript timestamps is cumbersome

### User Frustration Scenarios
1. **Educational Content**: Student wants to revisit specific concept explanation
2. **Podcast Episodes**: Listener wants to find particular topic discussion
3. **Tutorial Videos**: User needs to jump back to specific step
4. **Long Interviews**: Viewer wants to find answer to particular question

## Solution Design

### Core User Experience
- **Instant Search**: Type query and see results immediately
- **Contextual Results**: See surrounding sentences for each match
- **One-Click Navigation**: Jump directly to any timestamp
- **Visual Integration**: Search feels native to YouTube interface
- **Non-Intrusive**: Available when needed, hidden when not

### User Flow Design
1. User opens YouTube video (any length)
2. Extension detects video and fetches captions silently
3. User activates search via:
   - Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+F)
   - Extension button/icon
   - Context menu option
4. Search overlay appears with focus on search box
5. User types query → real-time results appear
6. User sees results with context and timestamps
7. User clicks result → video jumps to exact moment
8. User can search again or dismiss overlay

### Key Interaction Patterns

#### Search Behavior
- **Auto-suggestions**: Real-time suggestions as user types
- **Search History**: Remember searches for current video session
- **Multiple Results**: Show all instances of search term
- **Context Preview**: 2-3 sentences around each match
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handle typos and variations

#### Navigation Behavior
- **Instant Jump**: Video seeks to exact timestamp on click
- **Smooth Transition**: Visual feedback during navigation
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain search state during navigation
- **Return Option**: Easy way to continue searching after jump

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Speed**: Faster than manual transcript browsing
2. **Accuracy**: Find exact moments users are looking for
3. **Intuitive**: No learning curve required
4. **Reliable**: Works consistently across different videos

### Secondary Goals
1. **Non-Disruptive**: Doesn't interfere with normal video watching
2. **Responsive**: Works on different screen sizes
3. **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
4. **Performant**: Fast search even in very long videos

### Success Metrics
- **Activation Rate**: % of users who try search feature
- **Search Success Rate**: % of searches that result in timestamp clicks
- **Time to Find**: Average time from search to successful navigation
- **Repeat Usage**: % of users who search multiple times per video

## YouTube Integration Requirements

### Technical Integration
- **Page Detection**: Recognize YouTube video pages
- **Caption Access**: Fetch captions via YouTube's internal APIs
- **UI Injection**: Add search interface without breaking YouTube
- **Player Control**: Navigate video timeline programmatically

### Design Integration
- **Visual Consistency**: Match YouTube's design language

## Edge Cases & Considerations

### Content Scenarios
- Videos without captions available
- Videos with multiple caption languages
- Very short videos (< 5 minutes)
- Live streams with real-time captions
- Videos with music/sound effects (minimal spoken content)

### Technical Scenarios
- Slow internet connections during caption fetch
- Very long videos (3+ hours) with large caption datasets
- YouTube's caption API changes or restrictions
- Extension conflicts with other YouTube extensions
